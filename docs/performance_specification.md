# The Performance Specification


## Impact Factors

The factors affecting performance for vArmor's user-space and kernel-space components are as shown in the below

| Factor         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cluster scale  | As the cluster size increases, the CPU and memory consumed by the Manager for managing Agents also increase.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Resource scale | Creating a large number of VarmorPolicy CRs will result in increased CPU and memory consumption for Manager.<br />Frequent creation/modification/deletion of VarmorPolicy CRs will result in increased CPU and memory consumption for both Manager and Agent in response. |
| AppArmor LSM   | The basic overhead introduced when the kernel enable the AppArmor LSM.<br />The more rules in a profile, the greater the performance impact on processes.                                                                                                                 |
| BPF LSM        | The basic overhead introduced when the kernel enable the BPF LSM.<br />The more rules in a profile, the greater the performance impact on processes.                                                                                                                      |

## Resource Usage

vArmor user-space components use the resource quotas as shown in the table below by default.

| Version | Manager CPU | Manager Memory | Agent CPU   | Agent Memory |
| ------- |:-----------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| v0.5.11 | 200m / 100m | 300Mi / 200Mi  | 200m / 100m | 100Mi / 40Mi (The BPF enforcer is disabled)<br />200Mi /100Mi (The BPF enforcer is enabled) |

Explanation:

* The default values are derived from experience and simulated test results (enabling protection for 400*32 Pods with one VarmorPolicy).
* You can set higher CPU and memory quotas for large-scale clusters by adjusting the values of helm chart during installation.
* When the BPF enforcer is enabled, the Agent requires more memory during startup

## Performance

### Benchmark Testing for BPF Enforcer

We conducted a basic performance test of BPF enforcer (v0.5.0) on a VKE cluster with kernel 5.10 using [byte-unixbench](https://github.com/kdlucas/byte-unixbench).

*Note: We plan to conduct further comparative testing for typical applications and scenarios in the future.*

#### Test Environment

* Kubernetes version: v1.20.15
* Node number: 2
* The node host has AppArmor and BPF LSM enabled by default.
* Node specification: ecs.g2i.xlarge (4 vCPUs, 16 GiB RAM)

#### Test Steps

* Deploy a test workload (disabling the default AppArmor profile for the test container via annotation).
* Perform 10 consecutive baseline tests within the test container.
* Install vArmor
* Perform 10 consecutive baseline tests within the test container
* Create a VarmorPolicy for the workload (1 rule for each access control type)ï¼Œ then perform 10 consecutive baseline tests within the test container.
* Update the VarmorPolicy (2 rules for each access control type), then perform 10 consecutive baseline tests within the test container.
* Update the VarmorPolicy (4 rules for each access control type), then perform 10 consecutive baseline tests within the test container.
* Update the VarmorPolicy (8 rules for each access control type), then perform 10 consecutive baseline tests within the test container.
* Collect test data, calculate the average of the test data, and then use the test results without vArmor installation as the baseline to measure performance losses under different scenarios.

#### Test Results

* After installing vArmor v0.5.0, if the container is not sandboxed (or if the container is sandboxed with the AlwaysAllow mode), it introduces a maximum performance loss of 1.34% to container process (in terms of Execl Throughput).
* vArmor v0.5.0 introduces the most significant performance overhead in terms of Execl Throughput and Process Creation. When 8 rules of various access control types are set for container process, the maximum performance loss for execl is 2.55%, and the maximum performance loss for process creation is 2.32%.
* The File Copy 4096 bufsize 8000 maxblocks scores for different test cases fluctuate compared to the baseline, which is unexpected. Possible reasons for this could be:
  * When the elastic cloud server is under high load, file copying may be accelerated due to factors like cache heat, leading to fluctuations.
  * The host may experience overselling, which can result in fluctuations in baseline test results within the elastic cloud server.

### Performance Testing of Simulated Real Scenarios and Common Loads

To further compare different Enforcers in real scenarios, we used the [Phoronix Test Suite (PTS)](https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite) to conduct a series of automated performance tests on some common loads (Redis, Apache, etc.).

#### Test Environment

* Cluster version: v1.26.10-vke.18
*  Number of nodes: 3
*  Nodes with AppArmor & BPF LSM enabled by default
*  Node specifications: ecs.g3i.xlarge (4vCPU 16GiB)

#### Test Scenarios

In this round of testing, we performed horizontal comparisons of two enforcers: AppArmor and BPF. Each enforcer was tested in three typical scenarios, including AlwaysAllow, RuntimeDefault, and EnhanceProtect. The policies for each scenario are as follows:

* **Init Benchmark**
  
  No policy applied

* **AlwaysAllow**
  
  Tested with AlwaysAllow Mode, no rules enabled

* **RuntimeDefault**
  
  Tested with RuntimeDefault Mode, no rules enabled

* **EnhanceProtect**

  Tested with EnhanceProtect Mode, with the following rules enabled:
    - disable-cap-privilege
    - disallow-umount
    - disallow-access-procfs-root
    - mitigate-disk-device-number-leak
    - mitigate-sa-leak
    - mitigate-overlayfs-leak
    - mitigate-host-ip-leak
    - disallow-metadata-service
    - cgroups-lxcfs-escape-mitigation
    - runc-override-mitigation

In addition, we also tested the Seccomp enforcer with the currently available four rules. This test is for reference only and is not used as a performance benchmark or comparison.

The policy files used for the tests can be found in the [test/perf/policy](https://github.com/bytedance/vArmor/tree/main/test/perf/policy) directory.

#### Test Steps

We wrote a bash script to automate the testing process, which mainly completes the following tasks:

* Create and delete Pods in the Kubernetes cluster.
* Apply and remove different security policies.
* Initialize test configurations, install test tools, and run the Phoronix Test Suite.
* Record the test results.

Specifically, for the Init Benchmark, BPF, and Seccomp modes, we used different Pod configurations and enabled `container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/phoronix: unconfined` to ensure AppArmor was not enabled, avoiding the default AppArmor profile from affecting the test results.

You can find the Pod definitions and Phoronix runtime configurations in the [test/perf/policy](https://github.com/bytedance/vArmor/tree/main/test/perf/policy) directory. The automation test script is also located in the [test/perf](https://github.com/bytedance/vArmor/tree/main/test/perf) directory. Additionally, we have written separate test scripts for sysbench and unixbench, which you can use if you are interested in conducting your own tests.

#### Test Results

* **EnhanceProtect**: The performance of BPF decreased by about 1.2% compared to AppArmor.
* **RuntimeDefault**: The performance of BPF decreased by about 0.6% compared to AppArmor.
* **AlwaysAllow**: The performance of BPF decreased by about 0.1% compared to AppArmor.
  
  <img src="./img/pts_benchmark.png" width="600" />

The analysis results shows that although BPF generally exhibits slight performance degradation compared to AppArmor in different scenarios, the differences are relatively small. This indicates that BPF is a feasible alternative to AppArmor with acceptable performance overhead in security applications.

Below are the detailed test results for each scenario:
