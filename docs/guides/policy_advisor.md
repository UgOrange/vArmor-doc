description: Generate a policy template with policy advisor.

# Policy Advisor
This program can help you generate a [`policy`](../getting_started/interface_instructions#varmorpolicyspec--varmorclusterpolicyspec) template in the **EnhanceProtect mode** with built-in rules. The template can be a good start to craft the final policy. You can provide the context information and the behavior model data of the target application to make the template more precise. 

Please use the `-f FEATURES` and `-c CAPABILITIES` arguments to specify the context information. The `-f FEATURES` argument used to describe the application features. The `-c CAPABILITIES` argument used to describe the capabilities required by application explicitly. The behavior model data file is passed by the `-m BEHAVIOR_MODEL` argument. It's an ArmorProfileModel object that is generated with the **[BehaviorModeling mode](./policies_and_rules/policy_modes/behavior_modeling)**.


## Use cases
Generate a policy template that runs in EnhanceProtect mode with built-in rules supported by AppArmor and BPF enforcers.

`policy-advisor.py AppArmor,BPF -f share-containers-pid-ns -c sys_admin,net_admin,kill`

Filter out the conflicted built-in rules with behavior model data to make the policy template more precise.

`policy-advisor.py AppArmor,BPF -f share-containers-pid-ns -c sys_admin,net_admin,kill -m model_data.json`


## Usage
```
policy-advisor.py [-h] [-f FEATURES] [-c CAPABILITIES]
                  [-m BEHAVIOR_MODEL] [-d]
                  enforcers

positional arguments:
  enforcers          The enforcers supported by the environment.
                     Available Values: AppArmor, BPF, Seccomp (they should be combined with commas.)
                     For Example: "AppArmor,BPF,Seccomp"

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -f FEATURES        The features of the target application and its container. Providing as comprehensive features as
                     possible helps generate more precise policy templates.

                     Available Values (they should be combined with commas.):
                       * privileged-container: The target application runs in a privileged container.
                       * mount-sth: The target application needs to execute some mount operations in the container.
                       * umount-sth: The target application needs to execute some umount operations in the container.
                       * share-containers-pid-ns: The target container shares the PID namespace with sidecar containers.
                       * share-host-pid-ns: The target container shares the PID namespace with host.
                       * dind: The target application will create a docker in docker container.
                       * require-sa: The target application needs to interact with API Server.
                       * bind-privileged-socket-port: The target application needs to listen on a socket port less than 1024.
                     For Example: "privileged-container,require-sa,bind-privileged-socket-port"

  -c CAPABILITIES    The capabilities required by the target application and its containers. Providing the capabilities
                     needed for the application explicitly helps generate more precise policy templates. For example,
                     before Linux 5.8, loading BPF programs required sys_admin capability. Since Linux 5.8, loading BPF
                     programs requires bpf, perfmon or net_admin capabilities. If your application needs to load BPF
                     programs, please add both sys_admin and bpf, that is "sys_admin,bpf". See CAPABILITIES(7).

                     Available Values: CAPABILITIES(7) without 'CAP_' prefix (they should be combined with commas).
                     For Example: "sys_admin,net_admin,sys_module"

  -m BEHAVIOR_MODEL  The behavior model data is an ArmorProfileModel object that is generated by vArmor.
                     The input file must be in JSON format. You can export the data with kubectl command, such as:
                     kubectl get ArmorProfileModel -n {NAMESPACE} {NAME} -o json > model.json

  -d                 Print debug information.
