# Writing Policies
* You can refer to the [examples](https://github.com/bytedance/vArmor/tree/main/test/examples) to understand how to use the relevant features and write policies. 
* You can also try using [policy-advisor](../policy_advisor) to generate a policy template, and then build the final policy based on it.
* Here are some [demos](https://github.com/bytedance/vArmor/tree/main/test/demos) on how to use vArmor to mitigate vulnerabilities or harden containers with privileged capabilities.
