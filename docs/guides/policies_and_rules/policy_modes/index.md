# The Policy Modes

The modes can be specified through the `spec.policy.mode` field of [VarmorPolicy](../../getting_started/usage_instructions#varmorpolicy) or [VarmorClusterPolicy](../../getting_started/usage_instructions#varmorclusterpolicy) objects. The modes supported by different enforcers are shown in the following table.


|Policy Mode|AppArmor|BPF|Seccomp|Description|
|-----------|--------|---|-------|-----------|
|AlwaysAllow|[x]|[x]|[x]|No mandatory access control rules are imposed on container.
|RuntimeDefault|[x]|[x]|[x]|Basic protection is provided using the same default policy as the container runtime components (such as containerd's [cri-containerd.apparmor.d](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/contrib/apparmor/template.go)).
|EnhanceProtect|[x]|[x]|[x]|- It offers 5 types of [built-in rules](/built_in_rules#the-built-in-rules) and custom interfaces to meet various protection requirements.<br />- Enhanced protection is based on the RuntimeDefault mode by default. (The `spec.policy.privileged` field is `nil` or `false`)<br />- Also supports enhanced protection on the basis of the AlwaysAllow mode. (The `spec.policy.privileged` field is `true`)
|BehaviorModeling|[x]|[ ]|[x]|- Utilize BPF and Audit technologies to perform behavior modeling on multiple workloads.<br />- The behavior model will be stored in the corresponding [ArmorProfileModel](https://github.com/bytedance/varmor/apis/varmor/v1beta1/armorprofilemodel_types.go) object.<br />- Dynamic switching mode is not supported.<br />- Please refer to the [BehaviorModeling Mode](/behavior_modeling) for more details.
|DefenseInDepth|[x]|-|[x]|Protect the workloads based on the [ArmorProfileModel](https://github.com/bytedance/varmor/apis/varmor/v1beta1/armorprofilemodel_types.go) object.

<br />
Note:
* vArmor policy supports dynamic switching of running modes (limited to AlwaysAllow, EnhanceProtect, RuntimeDefault, DefenseInDepth) and updating sandbox rules without having to restart the workloads. However, when using the **Seccomp enforcer**, the workload must be restarted for changes to the **Seccomp Profile** to take effect.
* vArmor supports modifying policies to add new enforcers, but does not support removing enforcers that have been set. In addition, newly added enforcers only take effect for newly created Workloads.
